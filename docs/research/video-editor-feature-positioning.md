# Video Editor Feature Positioning

This matrix adapts the feature heatmap from
[`video-editing-market-landscape.md`](./video-editing-market-landscape.md) and
adds Popcorn Ready as the first row. It is intended for product
positioning and roadmap discussion, not as a formal benchmark.

Legend: `●●●` strong, `●●○` medium, `●○○` light, `○○○` minimal or not primary.

## Strategic Feature Map

This chart places products by center of gravity. The useful opening for Popcorn
Ready is the upper-right region: high AI orchestration while preserving a
deterministic, inspectable timeline and export path.

## How Popcorn Ready Differentiates

Popcorn Ready should not be positioned as another timeline NLE or another pure
text-to-video generator. The sharper position is:

1. **Prompt to structured plan to deterministic timeline.** The AI plans and
   patches structured data; rendering remains inspectable.
2. **Generation orchestration, not model lock-in.** The product can route image,
   video, voice, and future localization providers behind one workflow.
3. **Local-first provenance today, cloud provenance later.** The current local
   export/gallery model is a pragmatic starting point for later S3-backed
   project history, rights, approvals, and version tracking.
4. **Useful middle layer.** It sits between pro NLE rigor, generative video
   studios, and review/versioning systems instead of trying to replace all of
   them at once.
